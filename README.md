# FashionDesigner

Using a DCGAN, or Deep Convolutional GAN to generate fashion designs based on my own dataset of fashion images of clothes, outfits, etc. Have trained the discriminator and generator for about 1000 epochs, next steps are to label the images
and use transfer learning to generate actual clothing designs. Here are the outputs so far, just random patterns and stuff but they look really cool:
